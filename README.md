DOES NOT WORK. WILL FIX SOON.

# Discord Always Online

This is a python script which will keep you online as long as your computer is on and this script is running. It will click on a position which you define every 2 minutes (by default) keeping you online on Discord or another app. I don't know how well it will work on other applications but I can confirm it works pretty well on Discord.

## Requirements:
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [PyAutoGui](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)

## Usage:
- Run `always_online.py`. Click enter with your mouse over the position you want it to click when you are afk.
- You can change the number of minutes it takes before triggering in the variable: "minutes_to_click" in `always_online.py`. I recommend keeping this number below 2 minutes.


> ###### Other Notes:
This is probably not a great way to do this and I know that. I might work more on it in the future to optimize it.
